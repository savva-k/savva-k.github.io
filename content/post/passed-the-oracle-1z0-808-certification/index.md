Good news, everyone!

Even though this is the first blog in 2018, I'm still alive and I'm happy to say that I have passed the Oracle Certified Associate exam with 94% of correct answers (I still can't believe it ðŸ˜±).

It took about a month to prepare and I was spending all my free the time after work to read a book and write and test code examples.

While preparing, I have made more than a hundred of small notes, and I hope to find time and motivation in the next two months to post them here.

See you in 2019 ðŸ™‚ðŸŽ„
