Last year (as I remember it was 05 June 2014) we went rafting on a hand-made raft with friends. We used six 200 liters barrels and some planks, one of the guys made a paddle-wheel, which worked really bad, because the chain would always jump out of the sprocket. But it looked cool, it was an interesting mechanism. They rafted for two days, but I had to leave them on the second day, because it was my friend's birthday on 6 June, so I had to drive to another town to congratulate him and have some party. The route was around 50 km, and we went 25 km for 12 hours! It was really nice and funny. This year we will repeat our journey, I hope it will be at least like in last year, or better.
